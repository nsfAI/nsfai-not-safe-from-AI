NSFAI is built on a simple premise: AI does not replace jobs, it replaces parts of jobs. The tool analyzes your job description and the tasks you actually perform, then returns a 0–10 automation exposure score, highlights the most automatable parts of your role, identifies your harder to replace human moat, and suggests where to focus next. The score reflects task exposure, not full job extinction, and includes structural dampeners for roles involving physical unpredictability, real time decision making, legal liability, empathy load, or safety critical responsibility. It is not a macro forecast or a guarantee of job loss. It is a structured exposure model designed to help you identify which parts of your work are fragile and build around what is durable. This is a living model that will evolve as AI capability evolves.
