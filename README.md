What This Is

Everyone is arguing about AI replacing jobs.

But AI doesn’t replace “jobs.”
It replaces parts of jobs.

NSFAI analyzes:

Your job description

The tasks you actually do

And gives you:

A 0–10 automation exposure score

The most automatable parts of your role

The parts that are harder to replace (your “human moat”)

What you should focus on next

Important:
The score reflects task automation exposure, not full job extinction.
How the Scale Works

0–2 → Extremely resistant
3–4 → Low exposure
5–6 → Moderate exposure
7–8 → High task automation exposure
9–10 → Very high displacement probability

Structural dampeners reduce extreme scores when roles include:

Physical unpredictability

Real-time embodied decisions

Legal liability

Heavy empathy load

Safety-critical responsibility

Example:
A trauma surgeon may use AI heavily —
but full displacement probability is structurally limited.
Why I Built This

I’ve lived through:

Early crypto skepticism

A major consulting firm in a high-cost city

Almost mid six-figure meme trading gains

Losing it on leverage

Leaving corporate

Struggling to re-enter

At some point, the question stopped being:

“Is AI hype?”

And became:

“What parts of my actual work are structurally defensible?”

This tool is my attempt to model that honestly.

No doom.
No denial.
Just structure.
What It’s Not

This is not:

A macroeconomic prediction engine

A policy simulator

A guarantee of job loss

It’s a structured exposure analysis based on current AI capability trends.
Where This Is Going

Future versions may include:

Industry benchmarking

Longitudinal tracking

Public exposure datasets

Score calibration as models improve

If AI capability accelerates, this model should evolve with it.
Use It Like This

Don’t ask:
“Is my job safe?”

Ask:
“Which parts of my job are fragile?”

Then build around the durable parts.
Feedback

If you think the weighting logic is wrong, open an issue.
If you think the dampeners need work, suggest changes.
If you think the scale is broken, challenge it.

This is a living model.
